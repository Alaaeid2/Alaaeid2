## üåü Featured Projects  

- **Smart Assistant Glasses**: Built AI-powered glasses for visually impaired users, integrating five real-time models on NVIDIA Jetson Nano for enhanced accessibility.  
- **Online Exam System**: Developed a Django-based platform with Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, tailored for Arabic language assessments.  
- **Voice Command System**: Engineered a real-time speech recognition system using Wav2Vec2, achieving 90% accuracy.  
- **Conversational Chatbot**: Created a context-aware chatbot with LLM and RAG, deployed seamlessly using Docker.  
- **Text Detection and Recognition**: Built an end-to-end OCR pipeline using EAST for text detection and a custom-trained CRNN model (MJSynth dataset) for recognition, outperforming EasyOCR in speed and PyTesseract in real-time scenarios.
- **Recommendation System**: Designed a collaborative filtering-based recommendation system, trained with PyTorch and deployed on AWS for scalability.
- **IMDB Web-Based Sentiment Analysis Pipeline**:

‚Ä¢ Developed a sentiment analysis pipeline for IMDB reviews, training LSTM, hybrid Conv1D-BI_LSTM, and fine-tuned BERT models using HuggingFace Transformers.

‚Ä¢ Achieved 98% accuracy with BERT,outperforming other models on the test set.

‚Ä¢ Integrated NLTK for input validation,ensuring robust inference on user-submitted text.

‚Ä¢ Deployed BERT using Flask, building a web interface with Tailwind CSS and a REST API for real-time predictions.
